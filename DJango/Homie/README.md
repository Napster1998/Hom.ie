INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the exercise of getting an accomodations not only in dublin but also in entire ireland is getting tedious and hectic. People find it hazardous to get a reliable accommodation, and even if one is able to locate a home, there are atleast hundreds of views and more than half of its requests.
Hom.ie is a web apllication in which a user can find accommodations. The user could search accommodation by searching based on cities in ireland. It is reliable in a way that only shows active accommodation near you. The users are provided with a map view to locate the accommodation as per their preference.

Additional info
This information has been a personal issue to us during the house search in Dublin and surrounding areas.
A thought of simply having all this information in a proper format occurred.
This led to creation of Hom.ie, a Web Tool that when used will be able to consize the information and present it in a more readable manner
Services such as Daft.ie and others available didnâ€™t respond back and people had to rely more on the information available on platforms such as whatsapp groups with more than 500 members in each group with around 10 ads posted online everyday.
This meant that if people simply had a single place to access the data properly, one could be able find their accommodation easier.
