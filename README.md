Business Case







Nitish

We need to discuss the creation of the Database Structure. 
This will include Table creation, Who has the access and even what DB to use (I suggest SQL)
Secondly, we can all install the same IDE's so it would be a bit easier for us to understand.
We can code in Python so PyCharm is good.
